        <p>In Dec 2018 I found out I had celiac disease which is what challenged me to recreate all the meals and desserts so I can still enjoy them. Its been a fun procress to learn something new that also fits in this new lifestyle.</p>
        <li>Crafts and water color</li>

        <p>Painting was something I did in childhood that was always fun. There is something amazing about creating somethings new even if it doesnt turn out how you want. </p>
        <li>Road Trips</li>
        <img src="../assets/roadTrip.jpeg" alt="a road at sunrise" />
        <p>When I was young we did road trips often to see family who lived far away. This is something I still really enjoy because you get to see beauitful places that you dont see everyday.</p>
